@Element1 (visitors) and @Element2 (Picasso) are old friends sharing a warm moment together.

VISUAL FIDELITY – @Element2 IS THE MASTER:
Adopt @Element2's entire visual profile: color palette (or sepia/B&W), grain, texture, lighting, and shadow depth. Preserve background, architecture, furnishings, and objects exactly. @Element1 inherits this visual treatment while maintaining exact likeness, clothing, and appearance for each individual.

IDENTITY – PIXEL-PERFECT ACCURACY:
Every face must match the source exactly—frame-to-frame consistency throughout. @Element2 (Picasso): Preserve every facial feature, expression, and detail exactly. @Element1 (visitors): Lock each identity across all frames.

SCALE:
Picasso is 5'4" (163cm). Size all others proportionally based on their appearance in the source.

MOTION ORIGIN:
The source image (@Element2) captures a moment—posed or in motion. The video continues naturally from that instant. If Picasso is walking, he keeps walking. If dancing, the dance continues. If posing, the pose relaxes into natural interaction. Movement flows from what the source shows.

CHARACTERS:
All subjects move, gesture, and react with shared energy. Movement is expressive but grounded in realism. Picasso is fully animated and present, never a background figure.

INTERACTION:
Warm, friendly, platonic energy throughout. This includes: embraces, walking together, animated conversation, shared laughter, playful gestures, dancing, friendly pats on the back, joyful expressions. The interaction style matches the source moment—if casual, stay casual; if celebratory, stay celebratory.

BEHAVIORAL VARIABILITY:
Each source image produces unique motion. The arrangement, poses, and energy in @Element2 determine how figures move and interact. Let the source dictate the natural continuation.

CAMERA:
Naturalistic movement—slow drift or push-in toward group. Smooth, cinematic feel.

TECHNICAL:
Smooth, human movement. 9:16 ratio. 10 seconds.
