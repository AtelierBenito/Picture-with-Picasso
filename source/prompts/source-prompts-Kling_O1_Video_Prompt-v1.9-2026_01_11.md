@Element1 (visitors) and @Element2 (Picasso) are old friends reuniting after a long time apart. After posing briefly for a photo, their joy erupts—they embrace, laugh, and reconnect as if no time has passed.

IMAGE FIDELITY:
@Element1: Maintain exact likeness, clothing, and appearance for each individual. No blending or interpretation.
@Element2: Preserve source tone, texture, coloring, grain, and background without change. No added elements, no modern objects.

VISUAL FIDELITY – @Element2 IS THE MASTER:
Adopt @Element2’s entire visual profile: color palette (or sepia/B&W), grain, texture, lighting, and shadow depth. Preserve background, architecture, furnishings, and objects exactly. No modern overlays or digital clarity.

IDENTITY – PIXEL-PERFECT ACCURACY:
Every face must match the source exactly—frame-to-frame consistency with no approximations, no morphing. No facial drift, no identity mixing.
@Element2 (Picasso): Preserve every facial feature, expression, and detail exactly.
@Element1 (visitors): Lock each identity across all frames. No alteration of features, hair, or clothing.

SCALE ENFORCED:
Picasso is 5'4" (163cm). Size all others proportionally. No stretching, shrinking, or visual tricks. Visitors must appear naturally taller beside him.

CHARACTERS:
All subjects move, gesture, and react with shared energy. Movement must be expressive but grounded in realism.

INTERACTION:
Reunion energy—warm greetings, embraces, laughter, natural body language, and facial expressions.

BEHAVIORAL VARIABILITY (PER RENDER):
Across outputs, vary gestures, timing, and expressions. Preserve reunion tone, but no repeated actions or poses across workflows. Each video should feel fresh and unscripted.

TIMING DIRECTION:
Scene begins as a posed photo. A beat later, characters break into joyful motion—hugging, smiling, laughing, reconnecting.

CAMERA:
Naturalistic movement—slow drift or push-in toward group. Avoid abrupt motion.

TECHNICAL:
No duplicated limbs, distortion, or unnatural proportions. Smooth, human movement. 9:16 ratio. 10 seconds.
